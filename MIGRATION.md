# Migrating to Akzo SDD PBI Builder 5.0.0

## From 4.x
- Install or Upgrade as usual and allow reviewed updates. config.json gains an empty shared
  Angular UI path (sources.ui); set it in setup (or -UiSource) before using UI targets.
- PBI folders are not changed. A PBI created before 5.0 keeps the 4.x path rules (cdms and
  dab required), even when its pbi.json records CDMS, DAB or Both; Approve & Generate produces
  its application's PBI (or REFINED-PBI.md when none was recorded). To use the 5.0 targets
  (including the shared UI), start a new version of the PBI.
- Approvals: only the final user approval is required now. Approvals already recorded stay
  valid; a recorded PO/BA or technical approval is still checked for staleness. A 4.x PBI that
  waited only for PO/BA or technical approval can be approved with Review & approve.
- The 4.1 "Approved / Change Requested / Custom Response" choices are replaced by the form's
  Approve & Generate, Request Changes and Save Draft.

## From 4.1.0
- Install or Upgrade as usual and allow reviewed updates. Only the form changes; PBIs, decisions,
  approvals and settings are unchanged.

## From 4.0.0
- Install or Upgrade as usual and allow reviewed updates. The agent file and its guides change
  (direct legacy source analysis; selectable Approved / Change Requested / Custom Response
  approvals); unedited files are updated with backups, edited ones are reported, never
  overwritten. PBIs, decisions, approvals and readiness rules are unchanged.
- Start the installer with Install.cmd / Uninstall.cmd (the old names still work). They check
  the package and your execution policy first and never bypass it.

## To 4.0.0

## From 3.1.0
Install with the form or `Install-PBIBuilder.cmd -RepoPath <repo> -AllowUpdates`.
- Updated (with backups): the agent, `readiness-and-approval.md` and the other guides, the
  template, README, config and the form. Added: `skills/guided-pbi-creation.md`,
  `skills/crm-plugin-workflow-intelligence.md`, `skills/xrm-workflow-intelligence.md`,
  `skills/business-rule-ownership.md` and `skills/business-rule-branch-completeness.md`. The PBI template gains an application line and
  CDMS/DAB ownership columns.
- sources.yaml gains an `area` line per source (Custom (Legacy CRM/XRM), DAB (GraphQL), CDMS);
  keys and roles are unchanged. Questions may record `recommended` and `recommendedReason`.
- The Visual Studio agent gains the `find_references` tool; sources.yaml gains an `ideAccess`
  note (a sources.yaml you edited is reported as a conflict, as before).
- PBI folders are not changed. pbi-state.json stays schemaVersion 2; existing approvals keep
  their fingerprints and stay valid (tested). New fields (question options and answers,
  evidence `system`, `evidenceScope`) are optional.
- Added: `.github/skills/business-decision-advisor/SKILL.md`, a workspace Agent Skill. A file you
  already have at that path is reported as a conflict and kept.
- Create PBI uses a compact intake and autonomous investigation. Existing PBIs keep their
  questions, answers and decisions; option keys A/B recorded earlier still work, new questions
  use numbers. REQUEST.md may gain an "Investigation scope" section.
- Repository first: no end-to-end analysis document is required. SOURCE-DISCOVERY.md is no
  longer written (source access goes into EVIDENCE.md); the catalog, ownership, coverage and
  plugin-rule documents are written only on request. Existing documents in PBI folders are kept
  and read only as background. Readiness rules are unchanged.
- New installations leave the historical ColorDMS reports out (`-IncludeReferences` or the form
  checkbox adds them). An upgrade keeps the choice in config.json, so reports already installed
  stay; unchecking it in the form removes them only if unchanged, with a backup.
- An earlier installation in another folder (for example a project subfolder instead of the Git
  root) is not touched. Verify the new one at the Git root first, then remove the old one with
  the setup window's Uninstall (it only removes unchanged files it installed).
- An edited agent or guide is reported as a conflict and nothing is written until you resolve it.
- Rollback: restore from `playbook/pbi-builder/backups/<batch>/`, or install 3.1.0 again with
  reviewed updates allowed; it also removes the five new guides if unchanged (backed up first).

# Migrating to 3.1.0

## From 3.0.0

### Setup files
Install 3.1.0 with the form or `Install-PBIBuilder.cmd -RepoPath <repo> -AllowUpdates`.
File names are unchanged. The agent, the three guides, `config.json`, `README.md`,
`PBI-TEMPLATE.md` and the form are updated after you allow reviewed updates;
each replaced file is backed up to `playbook/pbi-builder/backups/<batch>/`. A setup
file you edited is reported as a conflict and nothing is written until you resolve
it (same rules as before). Never touched: `playbook/pbis/**`, knowledge notes,
backups, comparison baseline agents and trial folders, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

### Existing PBIs (pbi-state.json schemaVersion 1)
Nothing in a PBI folder is rewritten by the installer or the check.
- The readiness check still reads a 3.0.0 state. It reports `STATE_OUTDATED`
  and applies the 3.1.0 rules, so missing path scope, evidence records and
  criterion text are listed.
- A 3.0.0 approval recorded revision numbers, not what was reviewed. It is
  reported as `APPROVAL_UNBOUND` and never counts. **A 3.0.0 PBI that was
  Development-Ready is no longer Development-Ready until it is migrated and
  approved again.** This is deliberate: the reviewed content of those approvals
  cannot be established.
- To migrate, open the PBI with the agent ("Continue PBI <number>"). It copies
  `pbi-state.json` to `history/`, writes schemaVersion 2, moves each old approval
  to `approvalHistory` marked stale, and records anything it cannot establish as a
  gap. Then follow the normal review: run Check PBI readiness, present the
  consolidated approval request, record the new approvals with the printed basis.
- An existing `REFINED-PBI.md` stays in place. Until the PBI is Development-Ready
  again, the check reports it as `FINAL_WITHOUT_APPROVAL`.

### What is enforced by code and what depends on the agent
| Control | Enforced by |
| --- | --- |
| Status computed from state, documents and local evidence; approvals bound to fingerprints; document text, evidence references, path scope, decision log | Readiness check (form and PowerShell, identical results) |
| Migration rewrite of a 3.0.0 state, history copies, approvalHistory entries | Agent instructions |
| Asking the right owner, recording answers as stated, never editing a basis, not creating REFINED-PBI.md before the check allows it | Agent instructions |
| Whether an approver really agreed, whether content is correct, whether external evidence is current | Nobody: these remain human review |

The check reports; it cannot stop a file from being written.

### Rollback to 3.0.0
Restore the setup files from `playbook/pbi-builder/backups/<batch>/`, or install the
3.0.0 package again with reviewed updates allowed. PBIs migrated to schemaVersion 2
then show `STATE_SCHEMA` in the 3.0.0 check; their `history/` folder holds the
schemaVersion 1 copy.

# Migrating to 3.0.0 (from 2.0 or 2.1)

## What changes in your repository

| Before (2.0 / 2.1) | After (3.0) |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/agents/akzo-sdd-pbi-dynamic.agent.md` ("Akzo SDD PBI Builder - X") | `.github/agents/akzo-sdd-pbi-builder.agent.md` (same display name) |
| `.github/agents/akzo-sdd-pbi-dynamic-concise.agent.md` ("... Concise - X") | Retired; its behavior is part of the single agent |
| `.github/prompts/akzo-pbi-{new,refine}-concise.prompt.md` | Retired |
| `.github/prompts/akzo-pbi-{new,refine}.prompt.md` | Kept, now point at the single agent |
| — | `playbook/pbi-builder/skills/*.md` (guides the agent loads on demand) |
| — | `playbook/pbi-builder/REFERENCES-INDEX.md` (when references are included) |
| `config.json` with `conciseAgentName` | `conciseAgentName` dropped; `packageVersion` 3.0.0 |

Retirement rules, applied by both the form and `Install-PBIBuilder.ps1`:
- A retired file is backed up to `playbook/pbi-builder/backups/<batch>/` and removed
  only if its SHA-256 still matches the previous installation manifest, and only
  after every new file has been written and verified.
- An edited old file, or one without an ownership record, is kept and reported as
  `retire-conflict`. Delete it yourself, or change its `name:` line to keep a
  personal copy without a duplicate name in Copilot.
- If any step fails, every touched file is restored. An interrupted run (for example
  a closed window) can simply be rerun: files already written show as unchanged.

Never touched: `playbook/pbis/**` (requests, drafts, decisions, approvals, history),
`playbook/pbi-builder/knowledge/**`, backups, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
application code and unrelated agents.

## Existing PBIs
- Folders from 2.x keep working with Continue/Refine PBI.
- A `REFINED-PBI.md` written by 2.x without `pbi-state.json` is treated as a draft.
  The agent keeps it and creates the 3.0 records (`DRAFT-PBI.md`,
  `VALIDATION-MATRIX.md`, `pbi-state.json`) beside it, then revalidates and asks for
  approval before finalizing.
- Decisions recorded in a PBI stay with that PBI. They are never reused for another.

## New in the PBI folder
| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DRAFT-PBI.md` | Readable working PBI (template extended with actors, ownership, CDMS vs DAB, failures, data/state, readiness) |
| `VALIDATION-MATRIX.md` | One record per business rule with detailed evidence |
| `pbi-state.json` | Structured rules, criteria, owners, decisions and approvals for the readiness check |
| `REFINED-PBI.md` | Now created only after PO/BA, technical and final user approval are recorded |

## Rollback
- Restore files from `playbook/pbi-builder/backups/<batch>/` (same relative paths).
- Or install the 2.1 package again: it recreates its two agents and, after you allow
  updates, updates the shared files it owns (config, template, README, form) with
  backups. It ignores the 3.0 agent and guides; delete them yourself if you want
  only the 2.1 agents.
- To compare without rolling back, use Compare old & new with a pinned baseline.

## Windows installer
`Install-PBIBuilder.cmd` / `.ps1` install the same files as the form, from
`pbi-builder-bundle.json` generated by the same `core.js`. An existing installation
from the form is recognised (same manifest), and vice versa.
The browser stores `PBI-Builder.html` as it serializes the page and PowerShell copies
the package file, so switching installers shows that one file as an update.
